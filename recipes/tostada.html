    <h2>These easy chicken tostadas are just the thing for a busy weeknight. A fast spin on chicken tostadas, they can be done in about 20 minutes!</h2>
    <p>One of the best parts about this recipe is the simple ingredients that are easy to keep on hand.</p>
    <p>You can use corn tortillas in the oven to make tostada shells, and cook your own chicken and then shred it, but I prefer to use store bought tostada shells and pre-cooked chicken to save time. Depending on the chicken you use, it still tastes great!</p>
