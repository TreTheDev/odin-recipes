# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!
I expect to demonstrate adequate skills in HTML, and be able to build upon this project with more advanced HTML, later supplemented with CSS and Javascript.
I learned so much about Git and version control during this project. I now know how and when to commit any changes made. Also I am more organized with my folders on my PC and with uploading my files online. I hope to create a nice portfolio for the future.
